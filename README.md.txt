## Description

This project is a Java console application developed for MAD204-01 Lab 1.  
The application allows users to manage a simple gradebook, including adding students, entering and evaluating marks, and viewing per-student averages with letter grades.  
The menu-driven system demonstrates core Java programming concepts such as class design, arrays, ArrayLists, switch statements, all loop types (for, do-while, while, for-each), user input validation, type casting, exception handling, and recursion.  
A utilities submenu further illustrates operator precedence, type casting (widening and narrowing), and recursive countdowns.  
The code is well-documented, and robust input validation is present throughout.
